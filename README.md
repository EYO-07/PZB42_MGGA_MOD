# MGGA : Project Zomboid Mod for B42 Build

This mod is a bundle of my older mods wrapped together to improve the interface and gameplay and is a warm-up for myself to modding in B42. Entirely made on lua.
To install this mod you can subscribe on steam or download and put the MakeGameplayGreatAgain folder on "C:\Users\<user>\Zomboid\mods\".

Features: 
1. Aiming Auto Zoom - Aim Zoom In, Run Zoom Out 
2. Vehicle Auto Zoom ~ By speed 
3. Mouse Auto Facing 
4. Mouse Auto Zoom ~ By Distance from Player Object 
5. Temperature Display on Hotbar Border ~ By Color 
6. Active WalkTo 
7. User Interface to Control the GUI Transparency and Colors 
8. Condition Color Indicators for HUDButtons 
9. Auto Hide Graphical Interface when Aiming or Running 
10. Steering Indicator

TODO:
1. Pan The Camera on Auto Facing / seems not possible on lua-side 

The keysB42.ini is a suggestion of keybinding which works great with this mod and make the gameplay more comfortable, but is a little bit heterodox. 
To install it just put the keysB42.ini file on "C:\Users\<user>\Zomboid\Lua\".

Features of keysB42.ini:
1. Shove/Stomp on (Right Mouse Button) press 
2. Pan Camera and Running share the same key (Space)
3. Aiming on (Shift) 
4. ... other keybindins are default or none, which can be tweaked later editing the file or in options section in project zomboid.
